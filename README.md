# Sorting Algorithm Implementation
## Overview
This repository contains implementation of selection sort, bubble sort and insertion sort algorithms. These are classical sorting algorithms known for their simplicity but are generally inefficient for large datasets due to their quadratic time complexity. It also includes benchmarks comparing the performance of Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, and Insertion Sort. The benchmarks include runtime measurements for different input sizes, and results are plotted to illustrate the time complexity of each algorithm. The system information is also included to provide context for the performance results.


## Benchmarking Environment:
- **CPU**: 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-11800H @ 2.30GHz 
- **RAM**: 16GB (15.8GB usable)
- **OS**: Windows 11 64-bit
- **Python version**: 3.10.12

All the imports necessary to do the benchmark are in bechmark_test.py. An image of the plot is generated in png format as the output.
